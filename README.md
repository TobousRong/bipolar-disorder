static_postproc.m transforms the BOLD signal into the segregation and integration components, involving following process:
construct of individual static FC network; hierarchical modular partition; calculation of segregation/integration component; 
construct of stable FC network; stable segregation/integration components; fMRI-length calibration in individual level and regional level
